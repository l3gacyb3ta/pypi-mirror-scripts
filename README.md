# Pypi scripts
## Installing modules
Add all the modules you want to `toinstall.txt`, just like a requirements.txt file.  
Then run `downloader.py` to download everything.  
To run a server, run `server.sh`  
## Setup scripts
To generate setup scripts, run `Setup_commands/make_script.py`  
This will make a pretty cli and generate a script for you, compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
